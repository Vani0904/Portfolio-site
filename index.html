                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <div class="abt-row">
                        <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer with a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and object-oriented design. 
                            My experience spans across front-end and back-end development and I have a strong interest in developing practical, user-friendly applications. 
                            Over the past year, I have focused on learning core programming languages such as C# and JavaScript as well as HTML,CSS and PHP.
                            I have completed several proijects that emphasize clean, efficient code. I personally enjoy problem-solving and am dedicated to improving my skills through hands-on experience.
                            <p>
                            Recently, I have been working on projects that explore web development fundamentals, like building an e-commerce website and developing command-line applications. 
                            These experiences have helped me build a solid understanding of data structures, object-oriented programming, and version control.
                            </p>
                            <p>Beyond coding, I am passionate about technology and fitness, particularly calisthenics. I enjoy keeping up with current trends in tech and finding out new ways to improve my skills in coding and debugging. 
                            In my free time, I have focused on documenting my journey in calisthenics as it takes commitment to achieve a great level at the sport, overall combining my hobbies with a drive for continuous improvement. 
                            I look forward to collaborating on innovative projects that allow me to grow as a developer and make a positive impact.

                            <p>This Inventory management system was developed as a group, with the goal of implementing real features of an inventory system such as,
                                allowing admins to add,remove and update products, generate reports and issue invoices for over the counter purchases. 
                                The project allowed me to gain experience in both front-end and back-end and scrum methodologies, my main focus in the group was implementing the main
                                admin features allowing for products to be added,removed or edited and generate a report of all the available products and filter the inventory table to find
                                relevant data.

                            <p>This E-Commerce Website was developed in my free time, with the goal of replicating the features of a
                                fully functional, real-world online store. The project allowed me to gain experience in both front-end and back-end, 
                                and i focused on implementing secure user validation, user's orders page, and a user friendly interface. 
                                I also worked on optimizing performance and accessibility. Overall, this project 
                                deepened my understanding of developing websites fit for e-commerce, as well as integrating efficient back-end systems.
